## Measures of Performance
- Time: The amount of processing or number of operations code has to perform to accomplish itâ€™s objective.
- Space: This is both memory needed by code to store information at runtime as well as disk space needed by code for persistent storage.
- Network: The bandwidth code uses to pass information to clients or other machines. 

## Building Blocks?
The time required by code to run depends on the basic operations it performs. 
- Arithmetic Operations 
- Read
- Assignments
- Write
